Installation
============

`zELDA`, installation is divided in two blocks. First you will need to install the python package containing all the scritps. With this you can already use the Deep Neural Network methodologies to extract information from observed Lyman-alpha line profiles. The second block contains all the grids computed from `FLarEON`. This are necessary in order to compute line profiles and escape fractions for all the outflow geometries. As a consequence, the second block is mandatory to make MCMC analysis.  

Python package
**************

The simpliest way of installing `zELDA` is pip:

.. code:: python

          pip install Lya_zelda

An alternative method to install `zELDA` is downloading the code from GitHub:

.. code:: python

          git clone https://github.com/sidgurun/Lya_zelda.git
          cd Lya_zelda
          pip install .

Remember that if it is necessary you can also add the tag ``--user``
