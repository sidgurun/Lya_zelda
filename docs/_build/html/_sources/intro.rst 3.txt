Origins and motivation
**********************

Due to the Lyman alpha Radiative Transfer large complexity, the efforts of understanding it moved from pure analytic studies to the so-called radiative transfer Mont    e Carlo (RTMC) codes that simulate Lyman alpha photons in arbitrary gas geometries. These codes provide useful information about the fraction of photons that manage     to escape and the resulting Lyman alpha line profiles. The RTMC approach has shown to reproduce the observed properties of LAEs.

`zELDA` is a publicly available `python` package based on a RTMC (Orsi et al. 2012) able to predict large amounts of Lyman alpha line profiles and escape fractions w    ith high accuracy. We designed this code hoping that it helps researches all over the wolrd to get a better understanding of the Universe.

`zELDA` is **fast** and **simple**.

+ **Fast** : This code is able to predict Lyman alpha escape fractions and line profiles in an unprecedentedly low amount of time. In particular thousands of escape     fractions and line profiles can be computed in less than a second of computational time.

+ **Simple** : This code is only needs a few lines of code to be executed.
